Do you have hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia?

If so, you might want to avoid saying hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia, because hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia is the fear of long words!

According to [the wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia), hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia, pronounced  ` /ˌhɪ.pəˌpɒ.tə(ʊ)ˈmɒn.stɹə(ʊ)ˌsɛs.kwɪ.pɪˌdɑːl.ɪ.ə(ʊ)ˈfəʊ.bɪ.ə/ ` is "the fear of long words." Unfortunately, wiktionary adds, "it is unlikely that this 15-syllable contrivance is ever used purely for its meaning" noting that the term sesquipedalophobia is more commonly used.

That said, sesquipedalophobia, is nowhere to be found in the [Oxford English Dictionary](http://www.oed.com/noresults?browseType=sortAlpha&noresults=true&page=1&pageSize=20&q=sesquipedalophobia&scope=ENTRY&sort=entry&type=dictionarysearch), though the related [sesquipedalian](http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/176752?redirectedFrom=sesquipedalian&) `/ˌsɛskwɪpɪˈdeɪlɪən/` does make an appearance.

All of this has to make one wonder, where did this hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia and come from?

hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia [comes up empty in google's ngram viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia&year_start=1800&year_end=2008&corpus=0&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=) indicating that, according to google, the word did not appear in their rather large collection of digitized books from 1800-2008:

<div style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

<iframe name="ngram_chart" src="https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia&case_insensitive=on&year_start=1800&year_end=2008&corpus=0&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=" width=900 height=500 marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 hspace=0 vspace=0 frameborder=0 scrolling=no></iframe>

</div>

The same results for sesquipedalophobia!

Again, *sesquipedalian* does make a showing through the ages, hitting its peak around 1860:

</div>

Including these wise words from the The Christian Examiner, Volume 72, published in 1862:

<div style="width: 50%">
<p>It is very true that when the experiment of dictating is first tried the luxury of the ease it gives is apt to be so great that it tends to looseness and verbosity of style for there is no better check on sesquipedalianism than the necessity of writing down one's sesquipedalian words for one's self.</p>
