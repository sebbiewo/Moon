Do you have hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia?

If so, you might want to avoid saying hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia, because according to [the wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia), hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia is the fear of long words!

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/hippo.jpg" alt="a drawing of a hippo saying hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia?" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

But maybe we shouldn't fear it too much, as wiktionary adds, "it is unlikely that this 15-syllable contrivance is ever used purely for its meaning" wrly noting that "the term sesquipedalophobia is recognized in formal writing, while the four-syllable phrase *fear of long words* is certainly worth considering."

But even *sesquipedalophobia*, is nowhere to be found in the [Oxford English Dictionary](http://www.oed.com/noresults?browseType=sortAlpha&noresults=true&page=1&pageSize=20&q=sesquipedalophobia&scope=ENTRY&sort=entry&type=dictionarysearch), where only the related [sesquipedalian](http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/176752?redirectedFrom=sesquipedalian&) `/ˌsɛskwɪpɪˈdeɪlɪən/` makes an appearance.

All of this has to make one wonder, where did this hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia come from?

Both *Hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia* and *sesquipedalian*  [come up with zero results in google's ngram viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia&year_start=1800&year_end=2008&corpus=0&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=) indicating that, according to google, neither word appeared in their rather large collection of digitized books from 1800-2008.

*Sesquipedalian*, on the other hand, does make a showing through the ages, hitting its peak around 1860:

</div>

It was in 1862, just after *peak sesquipedalian*m that these wise words appeared in The Christian Examiner:

<blockquote>... there is no better check on sesquipedalianism than the necessity of writing down one's sesquipedalian words for one's self.</blockquote>
