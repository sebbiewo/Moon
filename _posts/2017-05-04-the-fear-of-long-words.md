Do you have hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia?

If so, you might want to avoid saying hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia, because hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia is the fear of long words!

According to [the wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia), hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia, pronounced  ` /ˌhɪ.pəˌpɒ.tə(ʊ)ˈmɒn.stɹə(ʊ)ˌsɛs.kwɪ.pɪˌdɑːl.ɪ.ə(ʊ)ˈfəʊ.bɪ.ə/ ` is "the fear of long words." Unfortunately, wiktionary adds, "it is unlikely that this 15-syllable contrivance is ever used purely for its meaning" noting that the term sesquipedalophobia is more commonly used.
